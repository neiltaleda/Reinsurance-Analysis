  **Conclusion:**
  
  This project analyzed health insurance business rules data across multiple years, issuers, and states using Power BI. The insights highlight how policy structures vary by geography, issuer, and year, with trends such as:
  * Rapid growth in the number of products offered between 2013 and 2015.
  * State-level differences in dependent age rules and family coverage policies.
  * Increasing inclusivity with domestic partner and same-sex partner coverage.
  * Market concentration, where a few issuers dominate product offerings in key states.
These findings demonstrate how business rules and product structures influence risk pools, market exposure, and regulatory dynamics
